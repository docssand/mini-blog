I read this book back to back after “Children of the fall” as the author cited this book for the scientific literature and I was interested in learning more about the octopi. The arguments are all well researched and often counter argued, but the most interesting aspect of the book are the anecdotes that the author links to the scientific research. The magic of the cephalopods is not lost in the prose that serves the need to grow empathy toward a very very alien but earthly being. I’m closing this book with more knowledge about this incredible animals and a new appreciation of their different type of intelligence. What a marvel!
